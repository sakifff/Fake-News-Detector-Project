# Final Project for Concordia Bootcamps


In this project, I have taken a dataset of real and fake news and have tried to make a few models that attempt to classify whether a news is real or fake.

Some notes:

- I worked on the LSTM model on google collab since I don't have a good GPU, so therefore some of the code needs to be changed if it were to run on a Jupyter notebook for example.
